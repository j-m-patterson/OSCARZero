# OSCARZero

## Purpose
Have you ever had to read a password out to someone over the phone?  Have you ever heard someone say "M as in Mancy"?  Has your brain ever been looking at an at-sign while your mouth said "ampersand"? 
Sure, if you start using something like the NATO phonetic alphabet, it doesn't take too long before you easily remember it, but even then....

Have you ever had to type a password in while reading it off a screen?  Was the font really clear and unambiguous? Could you tell with certainty the difference between 1 and l, or 0 and O?

If any of these things have ever been a problem for you, you may want to use this code.

## Packaging
Each directory contains code to do basically the same thing, but on a different platform.

### Android
This version, as one might expect is an android app.  

### Javascript
This version is an HTML page with an embedded javascript script.  Paste your password, hit the button, and read off the results.

### Python
This version is a python script which reads lines from stdin, translates them to phonetic output, and outputs them on stdout.

### Keepass
TODO:  write a C# version of this same thing that can be used as a keepass plugin directly.

TOMAYBEDO: add some code to all versions to generate a good strong random password.  For now, I'll trust that if you need to do such a thing, there are better tools available for it.

TONOTDO: iOS.  I don't have an iPhone.  I don't want one.  If you really want to write a version of this that works on Apple products, knock yourself out, I'll be glad to accept it.

Happy Passwording!

Enjoy!
